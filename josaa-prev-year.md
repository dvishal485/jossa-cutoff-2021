## Analysis

1. In top tier colleges,
    - Among 5 year courses `Mathematics & Computing` was at higher demand than before, followed by `Electronics and Communication Engineering`
    - Among 4 year courses `Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence` was at higher demand than before
    - `Engineering Physics` (5 year) & `Food Engineering and Technology` (4 year) are some of those courses whose cutoffs lowered as compare to last year!
    - Note : Cutoffs also varies due to number of seatings newly introduced, which we are not considering.
